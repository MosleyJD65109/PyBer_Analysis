# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of Analysis
Creating an analysis of Pyber's data and putting it into a readable, easy to understand, and visually appealing presentation format helps the custumer make data driven decision on where to allocate support and resources. This analysis first involves importing Pyber's data sets into a Pandas Dataframe and the merging the two data frames together. Techniques that aid in making the data visually appealing and easy to understand include creating bubble charts that compare the average fare and the total number of rides. The bubble sizes represent the number of drivers for urban, suburban, and rural areas. The most statistical compelling figures include the mean, meadian, and mode for total number of rides for each city type, average fares for city type, and total number of drivers for each city type.
